        Interesting, but not mind blowing. I feel like I could summarize the core of the book in a few lines,
        and the rest is mostly blabla.

        It's nice to have some figures on Pair Programming as it gives confidence in what otherwise would be just intuitive beliefs.

    lessGood: `
        This book is not concise and to the point. It repeats a lot of the same ideas, and sometimes even in the same unit (example:
        p21-p24: repetition that PP makes you not read your email).

        It also lacks real advice on how to practice PP: how much time before switching, how many breaks and how
        often etc. This books is more an academic essay than a inspiring book on how to spread the technique to new comers.
