        I am mitigated about this book. I can't say I didn't like it, but I don't feel it brought me as much as I expected.

        This book has a **lot of stories while also being funny**.

        - The code examples and corrections are not always very clean.
        - It's a "*feel good*" book (I take this term from Uncle Bob in *Clean Code*).
          It's nice to read, but most of the time, I felt it was lacking some concrete solutions to the problems described.
